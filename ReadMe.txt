PiToCharacter v 1.0

Author: Matthew Harding


What does it do?
	It takes 5 digits from Pi and translates them into a character.


How does it do it?
	99999/26 = 3846.12
	So the range    0 - 3846 is the character 'a'.
	             3847 - 7692 is the character 'b'.

Why?
	For fun! Obviously I can take more characters for more precision, and would then receive MUCH different results,
	but this method gives each character an approximately 3.846% chance of being selected. With a 0.0003% chance of
	being the wrong character. I feel that this is good enough for science. 

Will there be more versions?
	Maybe! I'm just doing this for fun. I would love to add more functionality to it like finding words in the results, etc.
